### Explain briefly how to deploy a Node/Express application including how to solve the following deployment problems:**

- Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a (potential) exception that closed the application

- Ensure that you can take advantage of a multi-core system
- Ensure that you can run “many” node-applications on a single droplet on the same port (80
